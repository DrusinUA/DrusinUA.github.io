                    <p>
                        Our games integrate Unity Analytics (the default, out‑of‑the‑box analytics service provided by
                        Unity Technologies) to help us understand gameplay and improve quality. Unity Analytics provides
                        aggregated, non‑identifying usage data such as event counts (e.g., level starts/completions),
                        device and platform type, app version, and general technical diagnostics. We do not use Unity
                        Analytics to collect personally identifying information, and we do not attempt to identify you
                        from this data.

                    <p>
                        We use analytics to monitor stability, diagnose crashes, balance gameplay, and guide product
                        decisions. We do not sell your data. We share data only with service providers that process it on
                        our behalf (for example, Unity) and only for the purposes described above, or if required by law.
